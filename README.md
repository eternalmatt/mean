# MEAN Factory

I'm Matt Senn and I work as a developer in Charlotte, NC.  I was interested by the programming challenge proposed by PassportParking and having a free Saturday, I thought it was a great opportunity.  I've recently been learning a lot of AngularJS, however, this was my first dive into the other three letters of MEAN. Luckily there is this awesome seed project which I got familiar with. I hope you enjoy.

## Prerequisites
* Node.js - Download and Install [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/). You can also follow [this gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) for a quick and easy way to install Node.js and npm
* MongoDB - Download and Install [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) - Make sure it's running on the default port (27017).

  MongoDB

    $ mkdir mongo-data/
    $ mongod --dbpath mongo-data/ --smallfiles
    
  Then checkout my repo and start the server

    $ git clone https://github.com/eternalmatt/mean-factory
    $ cd mean-factory
    $ npm install
    $ node server
    
  Then open a browser and go to:

    http://localhost:3000

## MEAN Stack

MEAN is a boilerplate that provides a nice starting point for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) based applications. It is designed to give you quick and organized way to start developing of MEAN based web apps with useful modules like mongoose and passport pre-bundled and configured. We mainly try to take care of the connection points between existing popular frameworks and solve common integration problems.
